This is the Programming Caesar's Cipher project I created during the Girls Who Code 2025 Summer Pathways Program. This cipher tool allows for the encryption and decryption of accepted messages, which include only uppercase letters. This program uses the Caesar Cipher, which involves shifting letters a certain amount of times to either get an encrypted message or a decrypted message back. The user will input a message using uppercase letters and select a key from 0 to 25, then finally pick if they want their message encrypted or decrypted. Afterwards, the user will receive the encrypted/decrypted result of their message. One thing I struggled with was figuring out the wraparound conditional, but it was actually pretty cool once I got it to work. Originally created on Replit in Python, Programming Caesar's Cipher is the third of five Python Cybersecurity projects from Pathways. I really love ciphers and cryptology/cryptography so this was a fun project for me.

### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Share an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Include user input for the initialMessage (only capital letters), the key, and the mode (encrypt or decrypt).
- Include a for loop that cycles through each character in the initialMessage.
- Include a conditional statement that allows for multiple word messages.
- Use a conditional statement to encrypt or decrypt the initialMessage based on user input.
- Use a conditional statement to adjust the position of any wraparound characters.
- Share the shiftedMessage with the user.


### Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Add another usability feature.
- Add a while loop to repeat the program.
- Explore other ciphers.
